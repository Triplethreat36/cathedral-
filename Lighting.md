Immersion and theme

so the lightting  i did on my map is i wanted it to be a more abonded ish feel but only resintly so everything is still intact. im mostly think this way since it is a deathmatch map.

the out side is bright since it will be day and the inside will be more dark with some rooms stil lit. I have the more lit room so player would exlpore them or feel inclinde to. the reason i did this was to have player go way from the center all the time even though that was my main intention but it worked to well.
