Immersion and theme

My choice for textures are ment to give a cathedral theme. Green stone,stone wall, wooden floors, and a cross of gold.  so hwo i went about this is not make everything one texture so have a bunch a difrent type of stone. one for the collums, ground, cross and others.

Some of the textures used is to indretcly guided the player arund like rugs and items. I used the rug to influes the player to right or left. the open spot in the belcony make the player to jump off.
